Crazy Eights, also known as Eights and as Swedish Rummy, is a distant relative of Rummy. It's known as a "stops" game because players can be stopped from discarding if they don't have a proper card. It's believed that Crazy Eights can trace its heritage back to the mid-1600s and a French gambling game known as Hoc.
